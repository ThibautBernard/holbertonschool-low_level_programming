# RECURSIVITY 
## Understand recursivity and use them when it's needed 

* **Re-write function in recursivity to understand the logic** (strlen, print_rev, puts)
* **Using mathematics and recursivity** (Factorial, Square roots, Pow)
* **Call another function recursive to add more parameters** (is_palindrome, square roots..)
